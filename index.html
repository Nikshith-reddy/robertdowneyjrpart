                While the plot of Avengers 4 is being kept tightly under wraps, it's widely assumed that part of the story will involve bidding a final goodbye to Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man.

                Whether Tony Stark is blown to kingdom come or gets to retire peacefully to an island with Pepper Potts, it would mark the end of 10 years of Downey Jr starring in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

                Downey was raised in an artistic household in New York City’s Greenwich Village; his father was a noted underground filmmaker who gave the five-year-old Downey his first part. After dropping out of high school in California, Downey returned to New York City to pursue an acting career. Supporting roles in several movies, including the cult hit Weird Science (1985), led to a stint (1985–86) on the television comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live. With his boyish looks and raffish charm, Downey then scored the lead in the romantic comedy The Pick-up Artist (1987) and broke out further with his visceral performance as a cocaine addict in Less Than Zero (1987).
